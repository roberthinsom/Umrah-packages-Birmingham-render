            <h2>Understanding the Umrah Visa</h2>
            <h3>What is an Umrah Visa?</h3>
            <p>An Umrah visa is a special type of visa issued by the Saudi Arabian government for Muslims intending to perform Umrah. Unlike a Hajj visa, which is valid only during the Hajj season, the Umrah visa is available year-round. It permits travelers to enter Saudi Arabia and perform the Umrah pilgrimage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eligibility</strong>: To qualify for an Umrah visa, you must be a Muslim, and your passport should be valid for at least six months beyond your planned stay. Additionally, you need to have a confirmed Umrah package booked through an accredited travel agency.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Prepare the following documents:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Recent passport-sized photographs</li>
                        <li>Proof of Umrah package booking</li>
                        <li>Vaccination certificates (e.g., for meningitis and COVID-19, as required)</li>
                        <li>Marriage certificate if traveling with a spouse</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Process</strong>: Most travel agencies offering <a href="https://cheapestumrahpackages.co.uk/umrah-packages-birmingham/">Umrah packages Birmingham</a> also provide visa services.
